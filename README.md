Happy Moments

One happy moment every day of 2015.

## Things I Used

- [My Gulp Starter](http://github.com/una/gulp-starter-env) for perf optimizations & a base to set up my server:
- [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) as a framework to run Node
- [Kimono](https://www.kimonolabs.com/) to scrape site and build an API out of it

## To Get Started Building on This:

1. Install node and make sure npm (Node Project Manager) is also [installed](http://blog.nodeknockout.com/post/65463770933/how-to-install-node-js-and-npm)
2. When inside the directory which contains this project in terminal, type `npm install`. If (and only if) you're having trouble with `npm install`, try `sudo npm install` -- this makes you act as a super user
3. In the terminal, `gulp`
4. Edit your Sass code inside of the scss folder. You can make subfolders inside of that to better organize your code. Prefix your sass files with an underscore. More info on using @import to organize your files [here](http://sass-guidelin.es/#main-file)
5. Your minified files will be automagically created and updated in `public/`. It will create your optimized css, html, and javascript files for you. Never edit files within the `public/` folder. (Dist stands for Distribution)
6. `app.js` has the node code
